% AUTHOR: Jared Oliphant
% DATE: 3/15/2019
%
% PURPOSE: a grader file that will allow you compile and run .cpp files
% within MATLAB; Other than that it is essentially the same as the previous
% AdaptiveInt Grader for MATLAB
%
% INPUTS:
% a filename corresponding to a student's code
%
%
% OUTPUT:
% score - a scalar between 0 and 1
% fileFeedback - a character array of feedback, containing grades breakdown.
%
