% PURPOSE: Function for grading Lab 9, part 3: Error plotting function
%
% INPUTS:
%   filename - a filename corresponding to a student's code
%
%
% OUTPUT:
%   Score - a scalar between 0 and 1
%   Feedback - a character array of feedback, containing a grades breakdown.
%
%
% VERSION HISTORY
% V1 - original
% V2 - Built in a error checker that will allow the students to flip the
% inputs 'N' and 'fhs' because the lab handout was a little too tricky and
% unfair.
% V3 -

legendweight = 0.1; %percentage of score based on having any kind of legend on either plot
Score = 0.55;        %bonus to add up to 1
