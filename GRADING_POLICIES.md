# Grading Policies for Autograder

The program is written and set up to run according to the following classroom and grading policies.

## Student Information
In order for grades to be correctly posted to Learning Suite and feedback sent out correctly to students, their email address should be current on their BYU personal information page.

## File Naming
Student submissions are assumed to have been uploaded to a Google Drive account with the following naming convention:

* The assignment name (e.g. "Euler", "SixDerivs", etc.)
* An underscore
* The student's course ID number

*Ex: Euler_122.m*

Anyone who messes up their course ID number, or fails to put an underscore before it, will not receive any credit. The autograder will simply pass them up.

The student submissions should be Matlab functions.

## Headers
The autograder will look for specific tags in the code to signify the start and end of the header. Currently, these tags are:

=====BEGIN-HEADER=======
=====END-HEADER=========

## Comments
The students' files are graded on whether they have comments *on every line*, except for "end" and "function" statements.

## Timeline for Submissions
The program works off of two deadlines: the first deadline is a week after the lab is assigned, while the second one is an additional week after the first deadline. Labs submitted before the first deadline will be termed "on-time" and receive full credit, while labs submitted between the first deadline and the second deadline a week later will be termed "re-submissions" and will receive up to 80% credit.

TA's should run the autograder right after their respective lab section's deadline, so that feedback can be sent out promptly and the students have the full week to make corrections if needed. If they do not run it before the next section's lab, their ungraded work will accumulate for other TA's to do.
